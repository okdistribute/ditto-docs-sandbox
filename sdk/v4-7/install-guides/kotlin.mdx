To install the Kotlin SDK and start syncing offline:
<Steps>
    <Step>
        Confirm that you meet the minimum requirements. ([Prerequisites](#prerequisites)﻿)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Prepare your environment for Ditto. ([Setting Up Your Environment](#setting-up-your-environment)﻿)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Configure your app permissions. ([Configuring Permissions](#configuring-permissions)﻿)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Authenticate with the Big Peer and then start syncing offline. ([Integrating and Initializing](#integrating-and-initializing)﻿)
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Prerequisites

Following are the minimum requirements that must be met before attempting to install Ditto.

- Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow)
- `minSdk` version 23.0
- `compileSdk` version 34.0
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11.0

## Setting Up Your Environment

Include the Maven Central repository in your Gradle file, and then synchronize it with your project.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From your project-level `build.gradle` file located in the app's root directory, ensure the `mavenCentral()` repository is included in the `repositories` section:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        // classpath for plugins, etc.
    }
}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Synchronize your project with the Gradle file by clicking **File **> **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Configuring Permissions

The Android operating system limits access to some device functionality for end-user control and privacy. In order to use this functionality, configure your app to declare and request permissions from end users at runtime:

<Steps>
<Step>
Review permissions used by Ditto. ([Declaring Permissions](#declaring-permissions)﻿)
</Step>
<Step>
Proactively check permission status to avoid unnecessary delay between granting access and Ditto being able to use the feature. ([Requesting Permissions](#requesting-permissions)﻿)
</Step>
</Steps>

### Including Required Permissions
Android requires certain permissions to be explicitly requested by the app to access features like Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi Aware. These permissions must be declared in the app's manifest file and requested from the end user at runtime.

<Info>
For more information, see the official [Permissions on Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview "Permissions on Android") documentation.
</Info>

To include the necessary permissions required by Android, and then do the following:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` located in the `android/app/src/main` directory of your project.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Within the `<manifest>` tag, confirm that the following namespace declarations are included and, if needed, add them to the beginning of the file:
    ```xml AndroidManifest.xml
    <manifest
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Within the same `<manifest>` tag, just before the `<application>` tag, add the following permissions:
    ```bash AndroidManifest.xml
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"
            android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"
            android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE"
            tools:targetApi="s" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"
            tools:targetApi="s" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"
            android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"
            tools:targetApi="s" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"
            android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
            android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES"
            android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"
            tools:targetApi="tiramisu" />
    ````
    </Step>
    <Step>
    To limit the Android OS from granting select permissions, use the tools:remove attribute to selectively exclude specific permissions from being affected by the android:maxSdkVersion behavior.

    Although using android:maxSdkVersion prevents unnecessary permission requests on older devices, it can also prevent your app from requesting the permission on devices running a newer Android OS version.

    Therefore, before restricting requests, consider how it may impact your app's compatibility and functionality on devices running newer Android OS versions.

    For example, the following snippet shows a configuration that requests permissions from end users regardless of the SDK version on the peer device:

    ```xml AndroidManifest.xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"
        tools:remove="android:maxSdkVersion" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
        tools:remove="android:maxSdkVersion" />
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Save the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Confirming SDK Dependency and Version

Ensure that your app’s build.gradle file includes the Ditto SDK dependency with the correct version:

```bash bash

1implementation "live.ditto:ditto:4.7.1"
```
### Ensuring Permissions Setup

To ensure your app has the required permissions for sync, use the DittoSyncPermissions helper class from the Ditto SDK. This helper class:

- Simplifies the process of requesting end-user permissions at runtime with a single method call (ensurePermissions) for all necessary permissions.
- Handles any errors encountered during the permissions request process.

### Using the Helper

To use the `DittoSyncPermissions` helper class:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Import the `DittoSyncPermissions` helper class in the main activity of your app:

    ```kotlin kotlin
    import com.ditto.sdk.DittoSyncPermissions
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Call the following in your Activity or Fragment's onCreate method:

    ```kotlin Kotlin
fun checkPermissions() {
    val missing = DittoSyncPermissions(this).missingPermissions()
    if (missing.isNotEmpty()) {
        this.requestPermissions(missing, 0)
    }
}
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>

    Refresh permissions after location access.

    On Android, after granting location access, Ditto may not immediately recognize the permission, causing a delay in syncing. To address this, whenever a relevant permission changes, call refreshPermissions() to quickly check and start syncing with the new permissions:

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrating and Initializing

Using the Application-level Context, integrate Ditto into your app's onCreate method. 

Most apps require that Ditto run as a *singleton*. A singleton is an implementation ensuring your Ditto instance accesses and shares a single object instance throughout your app.

To import the Ditto instantiate ditto as a singleton object, create a custom Application class subclass with the necessary initialization setup:Ceate and manage the Ditto instance within the Application class of your Android app. integrate Ditto into your app's onCreate method. 

<Info>
cBy doing so, you ensure that there is only one instance of Ditto throughout the app's lifecycle, and it remains available for use by any activity or component that needs it. This approach helps in efficient resource management and avoids unnecessary object instantiation and destruction.
</Info>

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Add Ditto to your application by placing it in your Application.onCreate method.

    <Warning>
    To ensure your app maintains a single Ditto instance throughout its lifetime and prevents it from going out of scope or getting garbage collected, place Ditto in the Application level Context instead of the Context from any activity where you initially instantiated the Ditto instance.

    </Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ```java Kotlin
try {
    val androidDependencies = DefaultAndroidDittoDependencies(context)
    val identity = DittoIdentity.OnlinePlayground(
        androidDependencies,
        appId = "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_APP_ID",
        token = "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN"
    )
    DittoLogger.minimumLogLevel = DittoLogLevel.DEBUG
    ditto = Ditto(androidDependencies, identity)
    ditto.startSync()
} catch (e: DittoError) {
    Log.e("Ditto error", e.message!!)
}
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>

Replace YOUR\_APP\_ID and YOUR\_PLAYGROUND\_TOKEN with your access credentials available from the portal. (See [Sync Credentials](/sdk/v4-7/getting-started/sync-credentials))

    </Step>
