title: Fields
description: A document consists of sets of fields that self-describe the data it encodes.
icon: table
iconType: solid
---

Each set signifies a single pair of two associated elements:

- The name identifying the field.
- The value that holds the data.

```json Ditto Document

{
  _id: "123",
  field1: "abc",
  field2: 1,
  field3: {
    sub_field1: "xyz",
    sub_field2: 2
  }
}
```

## Names

Similar to most document-oriented databases, you can only use `strings` to encode field names in documents.

For complete naming rules, see [IDs, Paths, Strings, and Keywords](/v4.7/document-model/fields#4Y_JMJedQeq0-0uDNcJcQ).

<Warning>
If you attempt to insert a type other than a `string` for a field property, as demonstrated in the following snippet, you will receive an error message.
</Warning>


```json
{
    1: "numeric_fields_are_invalid_here",
    "this_part": "numeric_fields_are_valid_here"
}
```
## Values

Field values can be encoded using various *data types*, including scalar type, providing flexibility in representing a wide range of information.

Following are the data types you can use to represent information in a Ditto document:

- `REGISTER`
- `MAP`
- `ATTACHMENT`

Each data type contains two distinct components: a merge behavior and a scalar value to store. (See [Data-Handling Essentials](/v4.7/document-model/fields#Z6tbFllqieU_CtkJR845E))

## Hierarchies

In the following structure, field properties are logically grouped to provide details about a specific car.

This structure includes an embedded object encapsulating both the GPS latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as the physical address where the car is located:
