<Update label="4.7.4 Version Release">

### ADDED: Support for specifying the mDNS connection ports for Small Peer SDK instances

Allows you to specify a specifc port that can will be used for mDNS announcements and connections on a given device. This can be used for connect with peers across a VLAN while scanning for open ports.

Not setting the config will result in the current default behavior of a random port being assigned.

<Warning>
If running multiple application on the same device, for example a debug and/or test flight application along side a production application, each application needs to have a unique port.

Failure to do this will result in only one application being able to establish connections at a given time.
</Warning>


***Setting the config***

The config can be set using DQL `ALTER SYSTEM` and the `tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port` config.

```sql DQL
ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234
```

This command should be run using the `ditto.store.execute(...)` command within your application.


<Warning>
`tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port` needs to be set ***before ***`startSync()` is called to be applied.
</Warning>

### FIXED: A finalizer issue that was causing crashes when closing sync subscriptions (#13849, #13732)

Resolves a race condition that could be hit when closing a sync subscription or stopping sync that caused Ditto to crash.

### IMPROVED: (Linux) Increased mDNS multicast TTL from 1 to 255 to allow for cross-VLAN announcements (#13590)

To support scenarios with cross-VLAN device discovery we increated the TTL to ensure message have enough time to reach their destination and get acknowledged.

</Update>
<Update label="4.7.3 Version Release" description="">
### FIXED: An issue causing a race condition with a Live Query callback. (#13180)

This fix addresses the issue causing a Live Query callback to receive a delta update, known as a *diff*, before the initial document.

### FIXED: A compatibility issue between documents created using different CRDT versions. (#13236)

Previously, there was an issue in which two documents on different internal versions could fail to integrate changes created using an older CRDT version.

### IMPROVED: Logging for batch write transactions. (#13339, #13339)

Due to a race condition caused by the logging system mistakenly identifying the previous transaction as blocking the current one, the logger would inaccurately indicate the current transaction as being blocked by the previous one from an `unknown` originator.

### FIXED: An issue in the Small Peer datastore causing slow performance or process termination. (#13395)

This issue was due to an aging dependency with a race condition, which caused thread tasks to get stuck and transactions to be blocked for extended periods.

### IMPROVED: The Ditto SDKs compilation performance. (#13174)

We've optimized compilation by reducing the size of each binary slice of the Ditto SDKs by 19% and fixing incompatibility with `PLCrashReporter`.

</Update>
<Update label="4.7.2 Version Release">
### ADDED: `mesh_chooser_avoid_redundant_bluetooth` system parameter. (#12984)

This new system parameter allows greater control over the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) connections in Ditto's peer-to-peer mesh network. When set to `false`, Ditto creates Bluetooth LE connections alongside other peer-to-peer connections, serving as a fallback if the primary transport, such as Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) or LAN, fails.

However, before you enable the `mesh_chooser_avoid_redundant_bluetooth` parameter, consider the following technical tradeoffs:

- Benefits:
  - Provides additional fallback to maintain connection stability when primary connections cease to function.
  - Reduces time to establish new connections since, by having multiple fallback options, Ditto can more quickly re-establish connections.
- Drawbacks:
  - Increases network traffic since using multiple transports results in additional network overhead
  - Using Bluetooth LE alongside other transports increases resource consumption. In the worst case, enabling this setting can result in slower sync performance and battery drain.

To enable  the `mesh_chooser_avoid_redundant_bluetooth` parameter, use the following DQL query:

```sql DQL

ALTER SYSTEM SET mesh_chooser_avoid_redundant_bluetooth = false
```

### CHANGED: The `AuthClient` by improving the log message for certificate issues returned from the Big Peer Authentication Service. (#13138)

### FIXED: A performance-related issue affecting bulk eviction operations for documents with attachments. (#12331)

### ADDED: Improved data compression in the handshake protocol when establishing connections to other peers. (#11264)

This allows peers with large permission sets to more quickly establish connections on low bandwidth transports like Bluetooth LE.

### FIXED: The HTTP protocol by adding `content-length: 0 header` compliance in empty `POST` requests. (#12346)

Before, if you invoked an empty `POST` request, the cloud load balancer would reject your request with a `411 - Length Required` error message.

Now you must explicitly state that the body of your `POST` request is empty by setting `content-length: 0` in the header of your HTTP API call.

### FIXED: Handling of malformed subscription queries in the legacy query builder API by adding validation logic early to ensure invalid queries are identified early and logged. (#12463)

There was an issue where invoking `subscribe()` on an invalid query caused sync to be silently disabled.

Invalid queries in the `subscribe()` method are now identified, disabled, and logged as errors.

### FIXED: Subscription assumption logic so all acknowledgments are processed, regardless of subscription changes. (#12541)

In scenarios where subscriptions rapidly changed back and forth while documents were being concurrently altered, documents would diverge at merge.

We’ve removed subscription logic ignoring acknowledgements based on assumed subscription mismatch and introduced salting functionality to ensure each document is unique for each occurrence of a subscription. This helps differentiate between new and reverted subscription states.

### FIXED: Sync inefficiency where changing a subscription resulted in unnecessary syncing of redundant update files. (#12967)

To eliminate redundant data from being synced unnecessarily, regardless of whether the remote peer previously acknowledged them, we’ve added validation checks ensuring that only unacknowledged data is synced.

This fix reduces sync update file sizes, leading to more performant session sync updates, particularly in apps consisting of large, stable subscriptions and infrequent document changes.

### FIXED: The authentication mechanism against WebHook providers for iOS and Mac devices. (#13160)

Before this fix, iOS and Mac randomly failed to authenticate against a WebHook provider with an error traced to the provider `NSString` not being kept alive for the duration of the login request, leading to authentication failure and resulting in an error message stating "no auth config set up."

The fix involved guaranteeing that the provider `NSString` persists for the duration of the dispatched login request, preventing premature deallocation of the string.
</Update>
<Update label="4.7.1 Version Release">
### Fixed: Misleading errors related to attachment fetch operations. Now, associated error logs are more accurate and clear. (#12409)

### Fixed: A specific issue where incorrect sync metadata rollback caused problems with data consistency at merge. (#12422)

### Fixed: Inconsistency in error logging and code translation for newAttachment and fetchAttachment operations so errors previously recorded at the error level are now recorded at the debug level instead. (#12235)

### Fixed: Errors that occur while creating attachments are now logged at the error level. Previously, they were logged at the debug level. (#12235)
</Update>
<Update label="4.7 Version Release">
### FIXED: The legacy query language error-throwing mechanism to accept invalid field names properly. (#11888)

After upgrading to version 4.7 of the SDK, you may notice unexpected errors while using the legacy query builder language. These errors are likely due to invalid field names or path expressions previously undetected.

In addition, make sure to start `unquoted_string` with an underscore (`_`), a letter, or an alphanumeric character. For example, the following equivalent regular expression: `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

<Warning>
In the legacy query builder language, invalid field names and path expressions now throw explicit errors. Previously these invalid names did not throw and would cause undefined behavior.

**Note: This new error-throwing behavior applies only to the legacy query builder language; DQL is unaffected by this improvement.**
</Warning>

### REMOVED: The `is_connected_to_big_peer` field from the Small Peer Info document. (#11883)

### CHANGED: The small peer info JSON metadata by increasing the depth limit to 64 levels. (#11891)

### IMPROVED: Transaction contention time for the `ATTACHMENT` data type, reducing potential timeouts. (#11893)

Before this improvement, concurrent write transactions were long-lived, potentially causing deadlocks and request timeouts. Now you'll experience more effective handling of multiple attachments being processed at the same time.

### FIXED: The issue causing sync crashes due to missing update files. (#11952)

With the latest release, Ditto handles unexpected situations or errors in a way that allows it to recover and continue functioning without crashing or causing disruptions.

### ADDED: Parameters for adjusting certain settings during runtime

This rollout includes new system parameters for the MeshChooser feature for configuring a limited set of variables, allowing you to adjust certain settings during runtime.

### RESOLVED: The warning message when peers connect is no more. (#11977)

The warning message previously logged when peers connected within the mesh is no longer recorded or printed.

### IMPROVED: Sync performance by sending the entire state of the data. (#12029)

Previously, when syncing in mixed mesh environments from Ditto SDK version 4.0.0 of the SDK to version 3.0.0, only partial updates were transmitted. With this release, all updates are transmitted, resulting in greater data consistency and completeness when syncing across different versions of the SDK.

### FIXED: The issue causing the Small Peer Info collector to become stuck. (#12051)

Previously, the Small Peer Info collector would become stuck when attempting to upload logs in certain situations. Since resolving this issue, the Small Peer Info collector functions properly in those conditions.

### FIXED: The issue causing fetch operations to appear unresponsive. (#9501, #12067)

With this fix, operations related to fetching attachments function as expected.

### FIXED: The issue causing type check failures when setting duration parameters through `ALTER SYSTEM SET`. (#12070)

When using `SystemParameter` to configure timeouts before this fix, if using different types to encode the values representing the timeout, for instance, `Milliseconds` and `Seconds`, the values failed to downcast, an error log printed, and the new value ignored.

Now, when using mismatched wrapper types, Ditto performs a compatibility check, validates, and, if needed, converts them as appropriate.

### ADDED: A log message warning for `deviceName` changes after sync start. (#11160)

We've added a warning message that logs when the `deviceName` property is set after the sync process has started.

Previously, setting `deviceName` of a Ditto instance after starting sync did not trigger a warning.

This new message warns you that the new value you've set only takes effect after you've restarted the sync process in your app.

### FIXED: The `deviceName` property on Ditto instances now reflects the truncation of the value to 24 bytes when starting sync. (#11160)

### ADDED: Properties `peerMetadata` and `identityServiceMetadata` to `DittoPeer`. (#11611)

### Added: Property `connectionRequestHandler` to `ditto.presence`, allowing filtering of incoming connections from other peers. (#11611)

### Added: Property `peerKeyString` to `DittoPeer` as a replacement for the now deprecated `peerKey`. ( #11611)

### Deprecated: The property `peerKey` for `DittoPeer`;  use the new `peerKeyString` property instead. (#11611)

### Fixed: `TransportConfig` retry interval (#12157)

Due to an issue in the `TransportConfig`, the retry connection interval was incorrectly set in seconds instead of milliseconds.

This fix corrects the interval to properly use milliseconds instead of seconds.
