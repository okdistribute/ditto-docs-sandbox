<Update label="4.7.4 Version Release" description="">

### ADDED: Support for specifying the mDNS connection ports for Small Peer SDK instances[](#7bb-i)

Allows you to specify a specifc port that can will be used for mDNS announcements and connections on a given device. This can be used for connect with peers across a VLAN while scanning for open ports.

Not setting the config will result in the current default behavior of a random port being assigned.

<Warning>
  If running multiple application on the same device, for example a debug and/or test flight application along side a production application, each application needs to have a unique port.

  Failure to do this will result in only one application being able to establish connections at a given time.
</Warning>


_**Setting the config**_

The config can be set using DQL ALTER SYSTEM and the tcp\_server\_bind\_mdns\_server_port config.

```sql DQL
ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234
```
<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
let result = await ditto.store.execute(query: "ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234")
```

```kotlin Kotlin
val result = ditto.store.execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234")
```

```js JS
const result = await ditto.store.execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234");
```

```java Java
DittoQueryResult result = (DittoQueryResult) ditto.store.execute(
    "ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234",
    new Continuation<>() {
        @NonNull
        @Override
        public CoroutineContext getContext() {
            return EmptyCoroutineContext.INSTANCE;
        }

        @Override
        public void resumeWith(@NonNull Object o) {
            if (o instanceof Result.Failure) {
                // Handle failure
            }
        }
    }
);
```

```csharp C#
var result = await ditto.Store.ExecuteAsync("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234");
```

```cpp C++
auto result = ditto.get_store().execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234").get();
```

```rust Rust
let result = ditto.store().execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234", None);
```

```dart Dart
final result = await ditto.store.execute("ALTER SYSTEM SET tcp_server_bind_mdns_server_port TO 1234");
```
</CodeGroup>

This command should be run using the ditto.store.execute(...) command within your application.

<Warning>
tcp\_server\_bind\_mdns\_server_port needs to be set _**before**_ startSync() is called to be applied.
</Warning>


### FIXED: A finalizer issue that was causing crashes when closing sync subscriptions (#13849, #13732)[](#yMx24)

Resolves a race condition that could be hit when closing a sync subscription or stopping sync that caused Ditto to crash.

### IMPROVED: (Linux) Increased mDNS multicast TTL from 1 to 255 to allow for cross-VLAN announcements (#13590)[](#XMZ7h)

To support scenarios with cross-VLAN device discovery we increated the TTL to ensure message have enough time to reach their destination and get acknowledged.
</Update>

<Update label="4.7.3 Version Release" >
### FIXED: An issue causing a race condition with a Live Query callback. (#13180)

This fix addresses the issue causing a Live Query callback to receive a delta update, known as a _diff_, before the initial document.

### FIXED: A compatibility issue between documents created using different CRDT versions. (#13236)

Previously, there was an issue in which two documents on different internal versions could fail to integrate changes created using an older CRDT version.

### IMPROVED: Logging for batch write transactions. (#13339, #13339)[](#NbwM6)

Due to a race condition caused by the logging system mistakenly identifying the previous transaction as blocking the current one, the logger would inaccurately indicate the current transaction as being blocked by the previous one from an unknown originator.

### FIXED: An issue in the Small Peer datastore causing slow performance or process termination. (#13395)[](#L8rbd)

This issue was due to an aging dependency with a race condition, which caused thread tasks to get stuck and transactions to be blocked for extended periods.

### IMPROVED: The Ditto SDKs compilation performance. (#13174)[](#13kNX)

We've optimized compilation by reducing the size of each binary slice of the Ditto SDKs by 19% and fixing incompatibility with PLCrashReporter.

</Update>

<Update label="4.7.2 Version Release" description="">
### ADDED: mesh\_chooser\_avoid\_redundant\_bluetooth system parameter. (#12984)

This new system parameter allows greater control over the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) connections in Ditto's peer-to-peer mesh network. When set to false, Ditto creates Bluetooth LE connections alongside other peer-to-peer connections, serving as a fallback if the primary transport, such as Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) or LAN, fails.

However, before you enable the mesh\_chooser\_avoid\_redundant\_bluetooth parameter, consider the following technical tradeoffs:

* Benefits:

    * Provides additional fallback to maintain connection stability when primary connections cease to function.

    * Reduces time to establish new connections since, by having multiple fallback options, Ditto can more quickly re-establish connections.


* Drawbacks:

    * Increases network traffic since using multiple transports results in additional network overhead

    * Using Bluetooth LE alongside other transports increases resource consumption. In the worst case, enabling this setting can result in slower sync performance and battery drain.



To enable the mesh\_chooser\_avoid\_redundant\_bluetooth parameter, use the following DQL query: ALTER SYSTEM SET mesh\_chooser\_avoid\_redundant\_bluetooth = false

### CHANGED: The AuthClient by improving the log message for certificate issues returned from the Big Peer Authentication Service. (#13138)[](#tJudh)

### FIXED: A performance-related issue affecting bulk eviction operations for documents with attachments. (#12331)[](#evsCB)

### ADDED: Improved data compression in the handshake protocol when establishing connections to other peers. (#11264)[](#GU3iK)

This allows peers with large permission sets to establish connections on low bandwidth transports like Bluetooth LE more quickly.

### FIXED: The HTTP protocol by adding content-length: 0 header compliance in empty POST requests. (#12346)[](#sB2RK)

Before, if you invoked an empty POST request, the cloud load balancer would reject your request with a411 - Length Required error message.

Now you must explicitly state that the body of your POST request is empty by setting content-length: 0 in the header of your HTTP API call.

### FIXED: Handling of malformed subscription queries in the legacy query builder API by adding validation logic early to ensure invalid queries are identified early and logged. (#12463)[](#_Cg-N)

There was an issue where invoking subscribe() on an invalid query caused sync to be silently disabled.

Invalid queries in the subscribe() method are now identified, disabled, and logged as errors.

### FIXED: Subscription assumption logic so all acknowledgments are processed, regardless of subscription changes. (#12541)[](#RB1u2)

In scenarios where subscriptions rapidly changed back and forth while documents were being concurrently altered, documents would diverge at merge.

We’ve removed subscription logic ignoring acknowledgements based on assumed subscription mismatch and introduced salting functionality to ensure each document is unique for each occurrence of a subscription. This helps differentiate between new and reverted subscription states.

### FIXED: Sync inefficiency where changing a subscription resulted in unnecessary syncing of redundant update files. (#12967)[](#JrcfC)

To eliminate redundant data from being synced unnecessarily, regardless of whether the remote peer previously acknowledged them, we’ve added validation checks ensuring that only unacknowledged data is synced.

This fix reduces sync update file sizes, leading to more performant session sync updates, particularly in apps consisting of large, stable subscriptions and infrequent document changes.

### FIXED: Compatibility issues preventing the React Native SDK from working correctly with older versions of Ditto. (#12641)[](#1o-uo)

This fix ensures the Ditto SDK is compatible with versions of React Native lower than 0.72.

### FIXED: Blank deviceName property on Ditto instances in React Native apps. (#12661)[](#iht9u)
</Update>

<Update label="4.7.1 Version Release" >
### Fixed: Misleading errors related to attachment fetch operations. Now, associated error logs are more accurate and clear. (#12409)[](#Ufm75)

### Fixed: A specific issue where incorrect sync metadata rollback caused problems with data consistency at merge. (#12422)[](#9ns52)

### Fixed: Potential for a crash when closing a Ditto instance immediately following operations such as setPeerMetadata or setPeerMetadataJSON. (#12351)[](#V0r-F)

### Fixed: Potential crash when closing a Ditto instance after calling Ditto.presence.observe() to register a presence observer. (#12388)[](#1fu39)

### Fixed: Premature triggering of asynchronous callback handlers created using observeLocal(). (#12388)[](#WYXGq)

Before this release, there were issues with the timing of callback triggers where the next callback in a live query could trigger before the asynchronous callback handler function had completed its execution.

</Update>

<Update label="4.7 Version Release">

### FIXED: The legacy query language error-throwing mechanism to accept invalid field names properly.

After upgrading to version 4.7 of the SDK, you may notice unexpected errors while using the legacy query builder language. These errors are likely due to invalid field names or path expressions previously undetected.

In addition, make sure to start unquoted_string with an underscore (_), a letter, or an alphanumeric character. For example, the following equivalent regular expression: \[A-Za-z_\]\[A-Za-z0-9_\]*.

In the legacy query builder language, invalid field names and path expressions now throw explicit errors. Previously these invalid names did not throw and would cause undefined behavior. **Note: This new error-throwing behavior applies only to the legacy query builder language; DQL is unaffected by this improvement.**

### REMOVED: The is\_connected\_to\_big\_peer field from the Small Peer Info document. (#11883)[](#Xpu6_)

### CHANGED: The small peer info JSON metadata by increasing the depth limit to 64 levels. (#11891)[](#SxoUO)

### IMPROVED: Transaction contention time for the ATTACHMENT data type, reducing potential timeouts. (#11893)[](#Rjz3Q)

Before this improvement, concurrent write transactions were long-lived, potentially causing deadlocks and request timeouts. Now you'll experience more effective handling of multiple attachments being processed at the same time.

### FIXED: The issue causing sync crashes due to missing update files. (#11952)[](#9cgAj)

With the latest release, Ditto handles unexpected situations or errors in a way that allows it to recover and continue functioning without crashing or causing disruptions.

### ADDED: Parameters for adjusting certain settings during runtime[](#PwBGo)

This rollout includes new system parameters for the MeshChooser feature for configuring a limited set of variables, allowing you to adjust certain settings during runtime.

### RESOLVED: The warning message when peers connect is no more. (#11977)[](#CJzIl)

The warning message previously logged when peers connected within the mesh is no longer recorded or printed.

### IMPROVED: Sync performance by sending the entire state of the data. (#12029)[](#Z7Fgl)

Previously, when syncing in mixed mesh environments from Ditto SDK version 4.0.0 of the SDK to version 3.0.0, only partial updates were transmitted. With this release, all updates are transmitted, resulting in greater data consistency and completeness when syncing across different versions of the SDK.

### FIXED: The issue causing the Small Peer Info collector to become stuck. (#12051)[](#Y5GCR)

Previously, the Small Peer Info collector would become stuck when attempting to upload logs in certain situations. Since resolving this issue, the Small Peer Info collector functions properly in those conditions.

### FIXED: The issue causing fetch operations to appear unresponsive. (#9501, #12067)[](#cMwRW)

With this fix, operations related to fetching attachments function as expected.

### FIXED: The issue causing type check failures when setting duration parameters through ALTER SYSTEM SET. (#12070)[](#qxejS)

When using SystemParameter to configure timeouts before this fix, if using different types to encode the values representing the timeout, for instance, Milliseconds and Seconds, the values failed to downcast, an error log printed, and the new value ignored.

Now, when using mismatched wrapper types, Ditto performs a compatibility check, validates, and, if needed, converts them as appropriate.

### Fixed (Linux): Similar to .NET, LAN communication (P2P) failed to advertise on newly added interfaces, such as enabling WiFi at runtime.[](#YSCcZ)

### Added: Similar to .NET, setting the deviceName property of a Ditto instance after sync has started will now log a warning, indicating that changes to the value only take effect after restarting sync.[](#r8ywS)

### Fixed: The deviceName property on Ditto instances now correctly reflects the truncation of the value to 24 bytes when starting sync.[](#mAhyh)

### Changed: Documentation for DittoError has been updated to include a usage example.[](#wqkBW)

### Added: Implemented the connectionRequestHandler property in ditto.presence, enabling filtering of incoming connections from other peers.[](#VS9cK)

### Added: Introduced the peerMetadataJSONString property and the setPeerMetadataJSONString method to ditto.presence.[](#Ugyo7)

### Added: Introduced the peerMetadata property and the setPeerMetadata() method to ditto.presence.[](#l2wCG)

### Added: Added properties peerMetadata and identityServiceMetadata to Peer.[](#TEO8O)

### Added: Implemented the peerKeyString property in Peer as a replacement for the now deprecated peerKey.[](#GcYxj)

### Deprecated: The peerKey property on Peer has been deprecated. Use the newly added peerKeyString property instead.[](#wYUJz)

### Fixed: Addressed an issue where DQL methods might include sensitive information in error logs. This fix removes the query string and query arguments from the context property of errors thrown by ditto.store.execute(), ditto.store.registerObserver(), and ditto.sync.registerSubscription() methods.[](#a0ifs)
