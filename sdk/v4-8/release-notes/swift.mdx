## 4.8.2 Swift Specific Changes 

No Swift Specific Changes

## 4.8.2 Common Changes

<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Fixed:** Setting the minimum log level to WARN or ERROR will now correctly filter out very early logger initialization messages. (#14451)

<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Fixed:** A bug that could prevent an attachment created with the same data on multiple peers from syncing. (#14481)
</Update>


<Update label="4.8.1 Version Release" description="Release Date: Sept 5, 2024">

### 4.8.1 Swift Specific Changes 

- Fixed: iOS devices may fail to sync on LAN when the app is backgrounded then foregrounded. (#14150)
- Fixed: AWDL may sometimes create spurious advertisements when app is backgrounded and foregrounded, affecting mesh connectivity (#14151)

## 4.8.1 Common Changes

**<Icon icon="plus"iconType="solid" horizontal /> Added:** The presence\_use\_multihop system parameter can be used to disable replicating presence information to other peers in the mesh, reducing network overhead. Use **ONLY** with guidance from the Ditto Customer Experience team. (#14128)

<Icon icon="rotate-reverse"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Changed:** When failing to load document data sync (replication) metadata, Ditto now attempts to clear and regenerate the metadata. This is a behavior change where previously Ditto would fail to start. This serves to prevent problems after SDK version downgrades. (#13111)

**<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> Fixed:** A rare issue where attachments may not be transferred between two peers.(#14158)

**<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> Fixed:** On-disk logs are more robust in situations with unexpected Ditto shutdown. (#13723)

</Update>

## 4.8.0 Common Changes

<Icon icon="exclamation"iconType="solid" horizontal /><Icon icon="rotate-reverse"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Changed:** The Logging output format for Ditto SDKs has been changed in 4.8.0 as part of our process to improve readablility and observability across the Ditto platform. Customers should validate the new data format in their existing data ingestion pipelines.

***New Logging Schema:***

YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssss LEVEL TARGET: MESSAGE \{field1=value1, field2=value2, ...}

- **Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM.ssssss):**

- **Format:** ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2024-08-16T14:23:05.123456Z).
- **Description:** The exact time when the log entry was generated.
- **Log Level (LEVEL):**

- **Format:** One of the following levelsâ€” DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
- **Description:** Indicates the severity or importance of the log entry.
- **Target (TARGET):**

- **Format:** A string, representing the internal module/area
- **Description:** The source of the log entry, often corresponding to the internal module where the error was called. (e.g. ditto\_init or peer\_event\_listener)
- **Message (MESSAGE):**

- **Format:** A human-readable string.
- **Description:** The main content of the log entry.
- **Structured Fields (\{field1=value1, field2=value2, ...}):**

- **Format:** A list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
- **Description:** Any additional structured data associated with the log entry. These fields can include custom data that you attach to the log entry using the tracing::info!(field1 = value1, "Message") syntax.
