Our Quickstart applications are task-based demos designed to help you quickly experience Ditto’s local-first database
and offline collaboration with minimal setup. Whether you’re building for mobile, desktop, or server environments, these
starter apps showcase Ditto in action, so you can see real-time syncing in just a few steps.

## Designed to Work Together

All Quickstart applications are built to work seamlessly with each other, regardless of platform.
This is made possible by using the same underlying data model, allowing different implementations—whether
in Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, .NET, or native SDKs—to sync effortlessly and interact in real-time.

## App Capabilities

Each Quickstart is a Task Management App with the following capabilities:  
<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Create tasks" icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" horizontal/>
  <Card title="Toggle task completion" icon="toggle-on" iconType="solid" horizontal/>
  <Card title="Delete tasks" icon="trash" iconType="solid" horizontal/>
</CardGroup>

After running through any Quickstart, you’ll have a fully functional app running that syncs tasks across devices, even without an internet connection.
