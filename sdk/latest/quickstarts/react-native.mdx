- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine
- A Ditto [Portal](https://portal.ditto.live) account with a configured Ditto Application (see [Getting SDK Connection Details](/cloud/portal/getting-sdk-connection-details))

    const identity: IdentityOnlinePlayground = {
        type: 'onlinePlayground',
        appID: '<YOUR APP ID>',
        token: '<YOUR PLAYGROUND TOKEN>',
    };
    ```
