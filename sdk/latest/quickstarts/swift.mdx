## Prerequisites

Dittoâ€™s Swift Quickstart supports **iOS**. Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- A macOS machine with the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (15 or later) installed
- A code editor (Xcode is recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
- A Ditto [Portal](https://portal.ditto.live) account with a configured Ditto Application (see [Getting SDK Connection Details](/cloud/portal/getting-sdk-connection-details))
- A physical iOS device or an iOS simulator for testing

## Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

<QuickstartCloneTheRepoBody />

### 2. Configure Ditto

#### Get Ditto App ID and Playground Token
<QuickstartConfigTitleAndAppIdBody />

#### Add Ditto Credentials

1. Copy the `.env.template` file at the top level of the `quickstart` repo to `.env` and add your app ID and online playground token.
    ```shell
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
2. Update the `.env` file with the App ID and Playground Token from your Ditto Application
    ```shell
    DITTO_APP_ID="REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_APP_ID"
    DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN="REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN"
    ```

### 3. Run the Application

1. Launch Xcode and open the `swift/tasks/tasks.xcodeproj` project.
1. Configure Signing & Capabilities
    - Navigate to the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project settings.
    - Set the Team and update the Bundle Identifier to match your Apple Developer account for provisioning.
1. Select a Build Target
    - In Xcode, choose a connected iOS device or an iOS Simulator as the run destination.
1. Build the Application
    - From the Xcode menu, select `Product > Build`.
    - This will generate an `env.swift` file using the values from your `.env` file and compile the app.
1. Run the Application
    - Select `Product > Run` to launch the app on your selected device or simulator.

### 4. Sync-Data Offline
