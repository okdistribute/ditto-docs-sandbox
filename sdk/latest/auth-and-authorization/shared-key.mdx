<Warning>
**Do not use the Shared Key auth model for public applications.**

Shared key is not suitable for apps deployed to the public app store, because the key could be reverse-engineered. Shared key is designed for enterprise applications run on centrally managed devices that do not connect to the Internet.

If you need to synchronize data over the Internet with the Big Peer or deploy to the app store, use `OnlineWithAuthentication`.
</Warning>

In this mode, every device knows the same secret key, and uses this to validate incoming connections. The benefit of this approach is that distinct certificates do not have to be distributed to every device, simplifying the deployment. However, the downside is that devices will always have access to data. A compromised device can read and re-distribute the key, and there is no method to unauthorize that key in the future.

Small Peers in this mode use a `SharedKey` identity type. The secret key must be provided as a string when initializing the `DittoIdentity` on each peer. This key should be securely and randomly generated and Ditto expects it to be in a particular format.

The recommended way to generate a shared key is to download Ditto's open-source, cross-platform utility [`ditto-authtool`](https://github.com/getditto/authtool), which provides an easy command to generate new shared keys from a terminal or command prompt:

```Text Text
./ditto-authtool generate-shared-key

// or

.\ditto-authtool.exe generate-shared-key
```

Alternatively, if you have a Linux machine running an up-to-date version of OpenSSL then you can use the following command. At time of writing this will not work on Macs.

```Text Text
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -outform pem | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der | base64 -w 0
```

The SharedKey identity requires an offline-only license token, which can be requested by contacting [support@ditto.live](mailto:support@ditto.live).


## How does Shared Key work?

Communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3 and peer identities are verified using certificates. This is the same state-of-the-art technology used in web browsers. It applies to every communication mode from Bluetooth to WiFi.

Each device issues a self-signed TLS certificate using the supplied private key. Peers then only trust peers whose certificates are signed by the same key. In other words, Shared Key uses regular TLS security, except everybody is the CA.
