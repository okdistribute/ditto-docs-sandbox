    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

# Configuring Permissions

Once you've added Ditto SDK package dependencies:

<Steps>
  <Step>

Configure your project's Info.plist file to ensure the necessary permissions for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and local network services are included. ([Ensuring Privacy Compliance](install-guides/swift#aor0j))

</Step>

<Step>
If enabling the Data Protection entitlement, allow access after your end users have unlocked their device for the first time after a system restart. ([Setting Protection Entitlement](install-guides/swift#Fb7Ze))
</Step>
</Steps>

## Ensuring Privacy Compliance

Configure your app for compliance with Apple's guidelines for iOS permissions by doing the following. For more information, see the official Apple documentation for [Privacy](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy "Privacy").

<Steps>
<Step>
From Xcode, add a new **Custom iOS Target Properties** entry:

1. From the left navigator area, click your project.
2. In the editor that appears, click **Info** tab.
3. Right-click any row in the list, and then select **Add Row** from the menu.
<Info>
For instructions on configuring permissions for your app, see [Cloud Authentication](auth-and-authorization/cloud-authentication).
</Info>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/v4.9/image-5.png"/>
</Frame>

</Step>
<Step>

From your project's Info.plistfile, add the following key-value pairs, which display as dismissable prompts to your end users explaining why the app requires certain permissions.

<CodeGroup>
```swift From Info Tab
Key: NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
Type: String
Value: Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices
Key: NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription
Type: String
Value: Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices
Key: NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription
Type: String
Value: Uses WiFi to connect and sync with nearby devices
Key: NSBonjourServices
Type: Array
Value: Item0: "_http-alt._tcp." (String)
```

```xml From Source Code
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses WiFi to connect and sync with nearby devices</string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_http-alt._tcp.</string>
</array>
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step>
If your end users prefer a language other than English, replace each default string assigned to Value with their language equivalents.

</Step>

<Step>
From Xcode, ensure your app continues to sync while it runs in the background, as well as when the end-user device is locked by enabling **Bluetooth Background Modes**:

1. From the left navigator area, click your project.
2. Click **Signing & Capabilities**.
3. Click **\+ Capability** and then, from the modal that appears, search and select **Background Modes**.
4. From **TARGETS**, select your app from the list.
5. From **Background Modes**, click to select the following:

- **Uses Bluetooth LE** **accessories**
- **Acts as a Bluetooth LE accessory**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/v4.9/image-6.png"/>
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Protection Entitlement

If enabling the Data Protection entitlement, allow access after the end user has unlocked their device for the first time after a system restart by setting the entitlement to NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication.

For more information, see the official Apple documentation for [Data Protection Entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_default-data-protection).

# Integrating and Initializing Sync

Once you've set up your environment, import the Ditto SDK in your codebase and obtain your access credentials.

<Note>
Unless you have a specialized use case, such as a government app, you must connect to the internet at least once before you can sync offline with other peers.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step>

From the top-most scope of your app's codebase, add the following to set up authentication and start syncing offline.

</Step>
<Step>

Replace YOUR_APP_ID and YOUR_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN with your access credentials available from the portal.

<Info>
For instructions on how to obtain your access credentials, see [Getting Playground Token Credentials](../cloud/portal/getting-playground-token-credentials)
</Info>

```swift Swift
let ditto = Ditto(identity: .onlinePlayground( appID: "YOUR\_APP\_ID", token: "YOUR\_PLAYGROUND\_TOKEN" )) do { try ditto.startSync() } catch (let err) { print(err.localizedDescription) }
```

</Step>
</Steps>
