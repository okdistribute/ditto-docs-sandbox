title: Flutter for Web
description: "Run your Flutter app on the web with Ditto."
---

Ditto is bringing web support to its Flutter SDK so Flutter applications can be
deployed to the web with minimal changes. This guide shows you how to get
started when porting an application for the web and explains limitations.

## Public Preview

Support for the web platform is currently in public preview. Not all features
are available and some APIs may change in the final release.

__Available APIs include:__

- Querying and observing documents in the Ditto store
- Sync with the Ditto cloud using sync subscriptions
- Managing transport configuration, starting and stopping sync
- Online with authentication and online playground
  identities.
- Configuring the Ditto Logger

__Coming soon:__

- Attachments
- Connection handling using connection request handlers
- Closing the Ditto instance
- Presence
- Small Peer info

## Getting Started

To use the public preview, add the `ditto_live` package to your `pubspec.yaml`
file with the version `4.9.1-web-preview.0`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ditto_live: 4.9.1-web-preview.0
```

Ditto's [Flutter Quick Start app](/sdk/latest/quickstarts/flutter) is a good
starting point for trying out Ditto on the web with an existing app.

Follow the [Flutter Install Guide](/sdk/latest/install-guides/flutter/flutter)
guide to get familiar with the basics of using Ditto in a Flutter app. 

For adding web support to your existing Flutter app, refer to the instructions
in the [official Flutter
documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building).
Ditto doesn't require any additional setup. However, some APIs have minor
differences as described below.

For production use it is strongly recommended to use compression for serving
web assets.

### Web Assets

When Ditto is used on the web, it needs to download and initialize assets for
its WebAssembly binary. This happens automatically when calling `await
Ditto.init()`. By default, assets are bundled with the application and loaded
from the same web server that serves the application. After running `flutter
build web`, you can find those in the
`build/web/assets/packages/ditto_live/lib/assets` directory.

Alternatively, you can host the contents of that directory on a CDN or other web
server and configure Ditto to load assets from there. All contents of the
directory, excluding the `ditto.wasm` file itself, must be reachable at the URL
given by the `wasmShimUrl` parameter. The `ditto.wasm` file can be served from a
separate URL given by the `wasmUrl` parameter. 

Configuration for loading all assets from a CDN:

```dart
await Ditto.init(
  wasmUrl: 'https://your-cdn.com/ditto-assets/ditto.wasm',
  wasmShimUrl: 'https://your-cdn.com/ditto-assets/',
);
```

Please consider your application's loading UI while downloading the assets as it
may take a few seconds to download and initialize the WebAssembly binary.

**It is strongly recommended to serve assets using a web server or CDN that
supports compression**. This will significantly reduce the download size of the
assets and thereby the loading time of your application.

### Permissions

Make sure that your app does not attempt to request permissions that are not
available on the web. Use Flutter's built-in `kIsWeb` constant to conditionally
request permissions only on mobile platforms.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

if (!kIsWeb) {
  await [
    Permission.bluetoothConnect,
    Permission.bluetoothAdvertise,
    Permission.nearbyWifiDevices,
    Permission.bluetoothScan
  ].request();
}
```

### Peer-to-Peer Transports

On the web, Ditto only supports syncing with the Ditto cloud and does not
directly connect to other devices. Make sure that your app only sets up
peer-to-peer transports on mobile platforms.

## Considerations for Web

- Flutter for Web is designed to work seamlessly with the Ditto cloud. Due to
  browser restrictions, direct peer-to-peer synchronization with other devices
  is not supported.
- The web platform utilizes an in-memory Ditto store, meaning data is not
  retained across page reloads.
- Dittoâ€™s Flutter SDK currently supports the [default build
  mode](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers#build-modes)
  for the web.
- When developing with Flutter's development server, it is required to quit and
  restart the server after making changes to the source code of your app
  (support for _hot restart_ is in development).
