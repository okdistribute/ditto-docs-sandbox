## Breaking Changes

During the public preview of the Ditto Flutter SDK, we aim to provide a stable experience while continuously gathering feedback and making necessary adjustments. However, we reserve the right to introduce changes, including breaking changes, prior to the official production release. Breaking changes will be reserved for critical situations only and will be communicated clearly in the release notes.

## Release Support
