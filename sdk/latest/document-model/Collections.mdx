## Structuring Collections

While it is good practice for documents within a collection to share a similar structure — for instance, all car-related documents stored in the `cars` collection contain fields `'make'`, `'model'`, and `'year'`  — structural uniformity is not mandatory.

There is no limit to the number of collections you can have in your data model, so create as many collections as you need.

## Managing Collections

Every document must be associated with a collection, even if only one document exists within that collection.

There are no explicit steps to managing collections; Ditto implicitly creates collections, assigns documents, and organizes references based on the documents being stored.

## Querying Collections


When querying, database interactions occur with collections rather than individual documents.

For instance, the query on the right searches the entire `cars` collection once executed.

```sql DQL
SELECT * FROM cars
```
### Declaring Types

To declare types, prefix the collection name with the `COLLECTION` keyword followed by a *type definition*. A type definition expresses the data types for the fields.

For example, here querying is against the `cars` collection with a field `properties` of data type `MAP`:

```sql DQL
SELECT * FROM COLLECTION cars (properties MAP)
```

For complete DQL syntax, see *Ditto Query Language *> [Types and Definitions](/dql/types-and-definitions).
