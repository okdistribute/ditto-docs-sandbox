<Note>The Flutter SDK follows a separate release cadence from our other SDKs to provide flexibility for
the initial GA release. During the 4.9.* series, the Flutter release version may not align with other SDKs.
This will be resolved starting with 4.10.0.</Note>

<Update label="4.9.1" description="Release Date: Feb 24, 2024">
  # 4.9.1
  <Icon icon="plus"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Added:** Support for Flutter 3.19.

  <Icon icon="rotate-reverse"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Changed:** Failing to call 
  `await Ditto.init()` will now throw. This is to prevent improper initialization.

  <Icon icon="rotate-reverse"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Changed:** `ditto.transportsConfig = config;` will now throw if `config` enables
    transports which don't exist on the current platform (e.g. AWDL on Android or P2P Wifi on iOS).

  `TransportConfig.setAllPeerToPeerEnabled()` will now take the current platform
    into account, and will only modify transports which are available. A newly
    created `Ditto` instance will not have transports enabled that are not
    available on the current platform 

  <Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Fixed:** Resolve an uncaught exception
   that could happen in `ditto.presence.graph` when there were P2PWifi connections.
  
  <Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench"iconType="solid" horizontal /> **Fixed:** The persistence directory
   behaves differently if a relative path is provided.
  
  If a relative path is provided, it will be treated as a subdirectory of
   `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. If an absolute path is given, its value
   is not modified. The `persistenceDirectory` parameter in `Ditto.open` is now
   optional, and defaults to `"ditto"`. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

<Update label="4.9.0 (GA Release)" description="Release Date: Jan 27, 2024">
    # 4.9.0 (GA Release)
    Weâ€™re excited to announce the General Availability of the Ditto Flutter SDK! Designed to
    empower developers building cross-platform apps, the Flutter SDK delivers reliable real-time
    data synchronization and offline-first capabilities, now production-ready!


    ## API Support Guarantees
    General Availability (GA) means API stability! Starting with `4.9.0` Ditto will guarantee semver
    support of all APIs following industry standards. For more on semver see
    [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

    ## Changes from the Public Preview
    To provide the best product with our GA release we've made some final modifications to the
    underlying architecture that bridges Dart and the Ditto Core for Android. The goal with this change
    is to provide a higher quality product with improved performance, reliability, and developer
    experience.
    
    These changes provide the following benefits:
    - Enhanced developer ergonomics through synchronous APIs
    - Improved performance for all operations across all platforms
    - Reduced complexity improving reliability
    - Reduced background operations for better battery life 
    - Lower memory consumption

    ## Breaking Changes
    This release contains a handful of minor syntax changes to provide an improved developer
    experience and better support the underlying framework. These syntax changes all stem from
    the ability to support non-async calls across the Dart-Ditto Core FFI.

    In the initial Dart-Ditto implementation all Dart internal calls were required to make async calls
    into Ditto. This required us to make all Ditto API methods `async`. Due to the improvements
    with our recent changes we are now able to provide synchronous methods. This change will bring a more
    natural developer experience.

    #### Ditto Initialization Required using `await Ditto.init()`
    From `4.9.0` and later it's required to call `await Ditto.init()` before using *any* Ditto
    functionality. Failing to do so can result in incorrect initialization of Ditto and unexpected
    failures.

    Notably, this must happen after `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` has
    been called.

    Flutter's `runApp` already calls
    `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`, so if calling `Ditto.init()` inside
    the `initState` of a `StatefulWidget`, it will just work.

    To initialize `Ditto` in `main`, use the following syntax:

    ```dart
    Future<void> main() async {
        WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
        await Ditto.init();
        runApp(MyCoolApp());
    }
    ```

    #### Select `asnyc` functions have become sync
    Select functions that don't require asynchronous execution have been converted from `async`
    to standard sync operations.

    *Changed Methods Include:*
    - `ditto.startSync();`
    - `ditto.store.registerObserver(...);`
    - `ditto.sync.registerSubscription(...);`
    
    *Example with basic replacement:*

    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    final observer = await ditto.store.registerObserver("SELECT * FROM tasks");

    // New syntax
    final observer = ditto.store.registerObserver("SELECT * FROM tasks");
    ```

    *Example chaining Future's with `.then()` (often seen in `initState()`):*

    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    ditto.store.registerObserver("SELECT * FROM tasks").then((observer) {
      setState(() {
        _observer = observer;
      });
    });

    // New syntax
    final observer = ditto.store.registerObserver("SELECT * FROM tasks");
    setState(() {
        _observer = observer;
    });
    ```

    #### Methods to setter/getter variables
    Async getter/setter method pairs have been converted to properties using Dart's getter/setter syntax, for a more natural
    developer experience.

    *Changed Methods Include:*
    |Previous|New|
    | - | - |
    |`DittoLogger.setMinimumLogLevel(...)` `DittoLogger.getMinimumLogLevel(...)`|`DittoLogger.minimumLogLevel`|
    |`DittoLogger.setCustomLogCallback(...)` `DittoLogger.getCustomLogCallback(...)`|`DittoLogger.customLogCallback`|

    *Examples*

    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    await DittoLogger.setMinimumLogLevel(LogLevel.debug);
    await DittoLogger.getMinimumLogLevel();

    // New syntax
    DittoLogger.minimumLogLevel = LogLevel.debug;
    ```

    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    await DittoLogger.setCustomLogCallback((logLevel, logString) {
        print("$logLevel: $logString");
    });

    // New syntax
    DittoLogger.customLogCallback = (logLevel, logString) {
        print("$logLevel: $logString");
    }
    ```
    
    #### Boolean functions renamed from `getFoo`/`setFoo` to `isFoo`
    For property types where the value type is `bool`, the functions will have been renamed
    from `getFoo` and `setFoo` to `isFoo`.

    *Changed Methods Include:*
    |Previous|New|
    | - | - |
    |`DittoLogger.setEnabled()` `DittoLogger.getEnabled()`|`DittoLogger.isEnabled`|
    |`ditto.setTransportConfig()` `ditto.getTransportConfig()`|`ditto.transportConfig`|

    *Examples*
    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    await DittoLogger.setEnabled()
    await DittoLogger.getEnabled()

    // New syntax
    DittoLogger.isEnabled
    ```
    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    await ditto.setTransportConfig()
    await ditto.getTransportConfig()

    // New syntax
    ditto.transportConfig
    ```


    #### Select Async Initialization is now Sync
    Objects with `async` constructors that didn't require asynchronous initialization have
    been changed for a more natural developer experience.

    *Changed Methods Include:*
    - All `Identity` subclass (E.g. `OnlinePlaygroundIdentity`)

    *Example:*
    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    final identity = await OnlinePlaygroundIdentity.create(
      appID: appID,
      token: token,
    );

    // New syntax
    final identity = OnlinePlaygroundIdentity(
      appID: appID,
      token: token,
    );
    ```

    #### Restricted Class Modifiers

    Many of our types are now either `final` classes (which prevent *all*
    subtyping), or `interface` classes (which allow `implements` but disallow
    other forms of subtyping).

    If you were previously extending or implementing a type and this is now
    disallowed, you can create a wrapper type:

    *Example:*
    
    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    class MockDitto extends Mock implements Ditto {}

    // New syntax
    class DittoWrapper {
        final Ditto _ditto;
        // constructor

        Future<List<Task>> loadTasks() => ...;
    }

    class MockDitto extends Mock implements DittoWrapper {}
    ```

    Some types may explicitly allow subtyping. Follow the API docs to understand when subtyping is best used.

    #### Removal of `dart:io` types in public API

    `Directory` and `File` are no longer found in our public API.

    For example `Ditto.open()` previously took a `Directory persistenceDirectory`,
    but this has been changed to `String`.

    This can be resolved by calling `.path`:
    ```dart
    // Previous syntax
    final persistenceDirectory = Directory("/my/cool/directory");
    final ditto = await Ditto.open(
      persistenceDirectory: persistenceDirectory,
      // ...
    );

    // New syntax
    final persistenceDirectory = Directory("/my/cool/directory");
    final ditto = await Ditto.open(
      persistenceDirectory: persistenceDirectory.path,
      // ...
    );
    ```

    #### Min Kotlin Gradle Plugin Version Upgraded to 1.8.0
    Supporting new Android capabilities requires using Kotlin Gradle Plugin version `1.8.0` or later.

    *To upgrade:*
    1. Navigate to the root folder
    2. Open `./android/settings.gradle`
    3. Update the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin to `1.8.0`
        ```gradle {3}
        plugins {
            // ...
            id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.8.0" apply false
        }
        ```
