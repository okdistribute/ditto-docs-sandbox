title : "Transport Overview"
---

The Ditto peer-to-peer network architecture supports both direct communication between Small Peers (device-to-device) and communication by way of a server ([Big Peer](/cloud)) that connects and transmits data between Small Peers (device-to-server-to-device).

This dual approach provides flexibility — your app remains efficient in any network environment and you control when and what routes through a central server.

<Info>
To enable all transports, call `transportConfig.enablePeerToPeer()`; otherwise, enable them one by one. (See [Customizing Transports Configurations](/sync/customizing-transport-configurations))
</Info>

Following are the various transports Ditto uses to facilitate peer-to-peer communication across peers:

- [Bluetooth Low Energy](#bluetooth-low-energy)
- [Apple Wireless Direct Link](#apple-wireless-direct-link)
- [Wi-Fi Aware](#wifi-aware)
- [Local Area Network](#local-area-network)


## Transport Connections

Ditto uses as many technologies as possible to communicate with other devices running your app. These modes, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and Local Area Network (LAN), are called *transports*.

While many transport methods are set up automatically, others, such as WebSocket, if configured with the Big Peer, require manual configuration.

## Connections

When an end user launches your app, the first thing they do is observe how quickly it syncs the latest information.

Ditto understands this. When sync begins, it uses all transports aggressively to locate and connect to multiple potential peers concurrently. At the same time, the existing peers notice the newcomer’s arrival. If capacity, they will also establish connections to the new device.

Together these processes ensure that a new peer is integrated into the mesh as quickly as possible.

A mobile phone has a finite battery life; therefore, after the initial burst of activity, Ditto must adapt to become more efficient.

Each additional LAN connection consumes more CPU time but also depletes radio energy. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) faces particularly stringent constraints — devices can only handle a few concurrent connections, and each connection initiation can take several seconds.

In larger meshes, Ditto must strategically limit the number of interconnections and choose them wisely to optimize efficiency.

<img src="/images/v4.9/image-14.png" />
</Frame>

At the same time, Ditto must not have too *few* connections; otherwise, *islanding* can occur.

*Islanding* refers to the isolation of different groups of devices within the same network. Put another way, it's a scenario where different groups of devices, located in the same room, are connected in individual clusters — if there is no connection between those groups, they will not sync data.

Ditto uses the following two techniques to prevent islanding, neither of which requires central coordination:

- Maintaining a reasonably dense mesh to minimize the likelihood of island formation.
- Implementing a *random* *churn*, where devices periodically change their connections to different peers.

  This implementation ensures that even if an island forms, it is likely to be transient and only last a few seconds*. *Random churning refers to the process in which devices slowly change which peers they are connected to.

Next, certain optimizations are possible.

For instance, improve the diversity of the mesh. Imagine that two peers are candidates for a Bluetooth LE connection; however, they only have the capacity for one. If you are already connected to one of those peers through a Wi-Fi connection, then the Bluetooth LE connection should be prioritized on the other peer to improve the diversity of the mesh.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/v4.9/image-16.png" />
</Frame>

Now, let's consider the same scenario but with the capacity for two Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) connections.

In this case, we would establish connections with both available peers. The Bluetooth connection associated with the Wi-Fi connection will remain inactive for the time being. However, if the Wi-Fi connection is lost in the future, Ditto will seamlessly switch to the pre-established Bluetooth connection without any noticeable disruption for the user.

It might sound complex, but there's no need to worry. All of these functionalities are integrated into Ditto, and your app will handle them automatically. You simply need to enable your transports, and Ditto will optimize their usage seamlessly.

## Multiplexer

In smaller meshes, Ditto creates multiple connections to the same peer using different transports.

While this approach may seem wasteful, it provides important performance benefits:

- Lower latency during the initial sync process since these transports race to establish a connection, with the first successful connection triggering sync.

- Ensures that large updates sync as quickly as possible by prioritizing the fastest available connection.

  Meanwhile, slower connections like Bluetooth LE, which have limited radio bandwidth, are preserved — remaining idle for peers in urgent need.

  If the fastest connection is lost, whatever the next-best option is ready to take over immediately, reducing or even eliminating the downtown when sync is interrupted.

The seamless switching between transports relies on a Ditto component called the *multiplexer*.

<Info>
Currently, the multiplexer utilizes one transport at a time with failover capabilities. However, in future versions, this feature will enable more complex scenarios, such as load-balancing across multiple routes and handling lossy transports.

## Bluetooth Low Energy
Ditto utilizes both traditional Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) to maintain a continuous mesh network of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections.

Bluetooth LE technology forms low-powered and high-distance connections between devices, making it highly performant in offline scenarios when replicating small amounts of data. 
<Info>
In the event of a Wi-Fi network disruption, such as a router getting disconnected, Ditto does not automatically switch transports to establish an independent Bluetooth LE connection as a fallback.

Instead, Ditto actively works to maintain the previously established Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE connections.

## Performance

The following distances, limitations, and capacities are approximations and vary depending on the Bluetooth® firmware installed in the end-user environment.

<Warning>
**Syncing large documents can significantly impact network performance:**

Caution is advised when handling large binary data, such as a high-resolution image or video exceeding 50 megapixels; a deeply embedded document; or a large document.

Instead of storing files exceeding 250kb directly within a document object, consider using an `ATTACHMENT` instead of a `MAP`. (See [ATTACHMENT](/data-types/attachment.mdx))
</Warning>

<Info>
Most devices manufactured during or after 2017 are equipped with Bluetooth LE version 5.0.

## Limitations

Bluetooth LE performance declines in the following scenarios:

- Physical obstructions, radio signal attenuation, radio frequency congestion, among other environmental challenges.

- Large amounts of binary data such as high-resolution image files or large document objects.

In addition, when iOS devices establish a Bluetooth LE connection with Android devices:

- End users can view the connection from their device's iOS Bluetooth settings.
- When your app is forced to close on the iOS device, the Bluetooth connection to the Android device automatically terminates.

<Info>
Visibility of these iOS-to-Android Bluetooth LE connections in the iOS settings is intended for informational purposes only. They do not limit the number of Bluetooth LE devices that can connect to the mesh.

## Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi

The bandwidth capacity and distance limitation of peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections depend on the end-user environment, as different devices and platforms support varying Wi-Fi technologies.

The following table provides an overview of the Wi-Fi technologies Ditto supports, organized by platform:

## Apple Wireless Direct Link

### Performance

AWDL-enabled mesh communication between Apple-based peers has significantly higher bandwidth when compared with Bluetooth LE, allowing for low-latency, high-speed data transfers.

| **Bandwidth Capacity**                                             | **Discoverability Range** | **Distance Durability** |

| - 5 GHz frequency range
- 1-Gigabyte maximum per 8-second interval | 30-to 60-meter maximum    | 35-meter maximum        |

### Limitations

With an average maximum range of 35 meters from point to point, AWDL allows for shorter distances when compared to Bluetooth LE, which can be sustained for distances up to 130 meters.

## Wi-Fi Aware

Wi-Fi Aware technology is a new open standard that you can use to establish a mesh network connection between devices running on the Windows or Android platform. 

### Performance

Wi-Fi Aware, similar to AWDL for the Apple platform, offers significantly higher bandwidth compared to Bluetooth LE, allowing for low latency, high-speed data transfers between Android or Windows devices:

<Info>
The following specifications are approximations; the type of device and platform and network configurations ultimately determine range and performance.

| - 2.4- to 5-GHz frequency range
- 1 Gigabyte per 8-second interval | 100- to 300-meter maximum | 100- to 300-meter maximum |

### Limitations

Wi-Fi Aware connections have a limited range of shorter distances compared to Bluetooth LE, which can be sustained for distances up to 130 meters. 

## Local Area Network

## Performance

In general, LAN-based connections offer significantly higher bandwidth capacities compared to Bluetooth LE, allowing for low latency, high-speed data transfers:

<Info>
The following specifications are approximations; the quality of the network infrastructure, network configurations, and the amount of network traffic ultimately determine range and performance.

<Info>
Disabled by default, if you want devices located within the same LAN to find and identify each other automatically, manually enable IP multicasting entitlement for each device. (See [Optimizations]())
</Info>

## Optimizations

This section provides an overview of the different optimization strategies you can use to make the most out of your LAN setup.

For instance, improve the overall responsiveness of your LAN connection by minimizing bandwidth consumption and enhancing the reliability of your peer-to-peer LAN connections.

### Optional Discovery Protocol: IP Multicasting

If you want your iOS app to connect to desktop-based apps over LAN, request the multicast entitlement directly from Apple, and then, once received, add the multicast entitlement to your iOS app. For instructions, see the official Apple documentation > Entitlements > <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_networking_multicast" target="_blank">com.apple.developer.network.multicast</a>.

Disabled by default, if you want devices located within the same LAN to find and identify each other automatically, manually enable IP multicasting entitlement.

### Security and Privacy: Client Isolation Mode

If network infrastructure is configured with *Client Isolation Mode* enabled, devices are unable to discover each other and form a LAN connection.

Client Isolation Mode is a network security and privacy feature offered by most Wi-Fi routers and access points that prevents devices on the same Wi-Fi network from communicating directly.

<Warning>
To ensure that Ditto's discovery protocol is working effectively, it is important to disable the Client Isolation Mode feature on the Wi-Fi router or access point that you are using for the LAN. For instructions, see the official documentation provided by the manufacturer.

Note that the exact name of the feature may vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific model of the Wi-Fi router or access point; however, the term “isolation” is commonly included in the feature name.
</Warning>

### iOS-to-Desktop Connections

Apple requires iOS device end users to grant permissions before a LAN connection with other devices can be established, such as an iOS device connecting directly with a desktop app running on the Windows operating system.

<Info>
By default, iOS devices can connect with other mobile devices of any platform. For example, an iOS device can connect directly with an Android device over LAN.
</Info>

## WebSockets

Small Peers connect with the Big Peer by way of *WebSocket *connections. Supported on all devices, regardless of model and platform, the WebSocket communication protocol is the most commonly available transport protocol for realtime communication.

A WebSocket* *is a full-duplex communication protocol that enables a *long-lived* connection between Small Peers and the Big Peer:

- Communication is *full-duplex* when the client and server can communicate in a bidirectional, back-and-forth manner allowing for low-latency data exchange.

- A connection is considered long-lived when, once established, it remains open for an extended period.

- Referred to as the *playground token*, Small Peers use this passphrase to authenticate with the Big Peer. Once authenticated, the Big Peer issues a unique JSON Web Token (JWT) to establish and ensure the persistence of the connection between Small Peers and the Big Peer.
