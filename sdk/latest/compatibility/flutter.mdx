## Breaking Changes

During the public preview of the Ditto Flutter SDK, we aim to provide a stable experience while continuously gathering feedback and making necessary adjustments. However, we reserve the right to introduce changes, including breaking changes, prior to the official production release. Breaking changes will be reserved for critical situations only and will be communicated clearly in the release notes.


## Release Support

While in public preview, the Ditto Flutter SDK can be used in production deployments with the support of our Customer Experience (CX) team. To ensure stability and smooth integration, we recommend working closely with the CX team during this phase.
