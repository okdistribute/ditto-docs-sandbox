description: "In mesh networking, where multiple devices share and sync data, conflict handling is crucial for data consistency."

Here are some best practices:

1. **Version Control with Metadata**: Each peer maintains a metadata database, storing version vectors to track updates and avoid conflicts during data merging.
2. **Deterministic Merging**: Ensure eventual consistency by adopting deterministic methods. Regardless of update order, all peers should converge on a single value.
3. **Meaningful Resolution**: Conflicting data should be merged predictably, representing the original inputs in a logical way.
