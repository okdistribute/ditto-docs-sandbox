## Data Flow

 To optimize data flow in such environments, follow these best practices:

1. **Leverage Multiple Transports**: Use a mix of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, and WebSocket based on device capabilities and network conditions. This ensures flexibility, resilience, and continuous connectivity, even in low-bandwidth environments.
2. **Minimize Latency with Localized Syncing**: Employ LAN and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi for local syncing, reducing the need to send data over long distances unnecessarily. This helps conserve bandwidth and improve responsiveness.
3. **Use Flood-Fill for Data Propagation**: Implement the flood-fill process, where data is transmitted via multiple hops across peers. This ensures data consistency across the mesh, particularly in offline-first scenarios, where peers might intermittently lose network connectivity.
4. **Optimize with the Multiplexer**: Make use of an intelligent multiplexer that seamlessly switches between transports without duplicating data. This feature maximizes bandwidth efficiency and prevents data loss during transitions.
5. **Ensure Conflict-Free Synchronization**: Design systems that resolve concurrency conflicts using version vectors and metadata databases. This guarantees eventual consistency among peers, especially when dealing with asynchronous updates.
