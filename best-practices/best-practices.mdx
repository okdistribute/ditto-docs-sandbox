## Introduction to Ditto

Ditto is designed to help you **sync data in real-time across devices**, even in low-connectivity environments. With **P2P mesh networking** and an **offline-first architecture**, Ditto ensures that your app remains **functional and responsive**, no matter the network conditions.

To get the most out of Ditto, it's important to follow best practices for **data modeling**, **sync logic**, **security** and **performance optimization**. This guide walks you through each of these important areas to ensure that your Ditto implementation is efficient, scalable, and secure.

## Key concepts

here are a few key concepts that are fundamental to building with Ditto:

- **Offline-First Architecture:** Designing apps that can operate offline and synchronize seamlessly when network connectivity is restored.
- **Peer-to-Peer Sync:** Ditto's unique ability to sync data directly between devices without the need for a central server.
- **Data Modeling for Sync:** Structuring your data in a way that optimizes performance, minimizes conflicts, and ensure consistency across devices.

## Getting Started in 3 Simple Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK:">

Select your platform from the [Directory of Install Guides](/sdk/latest/install-guides/install-guides) and follow the steps to set up the SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Ditto in your App:">
After installation, you'll need to initialize the Ditto SDK and set up your app to begin syncing data. Follow your chosen install guide for details on how to get up and running.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync Your Data:">
  With Ditto integrated, you can now [start syncing data](/sdk/latest/sync/syncing-data) across devices. Follow the [CRUD operations guide](/sdk/latest/crud/create) to learn how to create, read, update, and delete data in your app.
