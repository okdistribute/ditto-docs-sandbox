Key best practices include:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Encrypt all communication to ensure data is inaccessible to intermediaries.
2. **Anonymized Peer Discovery**: Use methods that minimize exposure of device metadata to unauthorized parties.
3. **Data Minimization**: Share only the essential data required for communication, reducing privacy risks.
4. **User Control**: Enable users to manage and control their data-sharing preferences, adhering to privacy regulations.
