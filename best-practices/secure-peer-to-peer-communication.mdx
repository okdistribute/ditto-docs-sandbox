Below are key best practices:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure all data exchanged between peers is encrypted, using protocols like TLS or custom end-to-end encryption schemes.
2. **Mutual Authentication**: Implement strong authentication using OAuth, JWT, or cryptographic handshakes to verify both peers.
3. **Secure Transport Layers**: Use secure transports such as WebSockets or Bluetooth LE with encrypted channels to prevent eavesdropping.
4. **Key Management**: Regularly rotate encryption keys to prevent compromise over time.
