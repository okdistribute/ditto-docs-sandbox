You can integrate the Ditto SDK into C++ projects to develop for Linux and iOS platforms.

<Info>
For a complete overview of the platforms, transports, and devices the C# SDK supports, select **C++ **from the [Directory of Compatibility Maps](<./../../Compatibility Maps/Directory of Compatibility Maps.md>).
</Info>

<Info>
For the API reference, see <a href="https://software.ditto.live/cpp/Ditto/4.7.1/api-reference/" target="_blank">Ditto 4.7.1 API Reference Documentation</a>.
</Info>


To install the C++ SDK:

<Steps>
<Step>
Fetch and extract the Ditto package. ([Downloading and Unpacking Ditto]())
</Step>

<Step>
Configure your app to link to the Ditto static library. ([Linking to Ditto]())
</Step>
</Steps>


## Downloading and Unpacking Ditto

Download `Ditto.tar.gz` and unpack an archive containing the `libditto.a` static library and `Ditto` header:

<CodeGroup>
```curl Linux x86_64
curl -O https://software.ditto.live/cpp-linux-x86_64/Ditto/4.7.4/dist/Ditto.tar.gz && tar xvfz Ditto.tar.gz
```

```curl Linux aarch64
curl -O https://software.ditto.live/cpp-linux-aarch64/Ditto/4.7.4/dist/Ditto.tar.gz && tar xvfz Ditto.tar.gz
```
</CodeGroup>

## Linking to Ditto

Add `-lditto` as a compilation step in the `main.cpp` source file:


<Info>
For instructions on adding cross-platform Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) capabilities, see [Bluetooth on Linux]().

*BlueZ* is the official Bluetooth protocol stack implementation for Linux systems to communicate with other Bluetooth-enabled platforms.

</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```curl Linux
# This command assumes:
# You have unzipped the Ditto.tar.gz in a relative directory ./sdk/
# Your main code entry point is in ./src/main.cpp

g++ -std=c++17 ./src/main.cpp -I ./sdk -lditto -ldl -lrt -pthread -L ./sdk -o dist/main;

 # Once executed, your output will be available at: ./dist/main
```

```bash iOS
#This command assumes:
# You have unzipped the Ditto.tar.gz in a relative directory ./sdk/
# Your main code entry point is in ./src/main.cpp

g++ -std=c++17 ./src/main.cpp -I ./sdk -lditto -ldl -framework Security,CoreFoundation,CoreBluetooth,ObjC -pthread -L ./sdk -o dist/main;

# Note: By adding the "-framework Security,CoreFoundation,CoreBluetooth,ObjC.," you enable the C++ SDK to leverage iOS peer-to-peer networks.

 # Once executed, your output will be available at: ./dist/main
```
</CodeGroup>

## Importing Ditto

From the source code of your app, using `#include <Ditto.h>`,  import Ditto and provide your access credentials:

```cpp C++
auto identity =
    Identity::OnlinePlayground("YOUR_APP_ID", "PLAYGROUND_TOKEN", true);
try {
  Ditto ditto = Ditto(identity, dir);
  ditto.set_minimum_log_level(LogLevel::debug);
  ditto.start_sync();
} catch (const DittoError &err) {
}
```
