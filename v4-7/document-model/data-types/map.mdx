title: MAP
description: "An alternative approach to using a JSON object as a `REGISTER` to represent and organize data in a hierarchical structure within a document is to use a `MAP`."

The `MAP` type uses the add-wins approach to resolving concurrency conflicts.

So instead of choosing a single definitive value to merge and distribute across peers like the last-write-wins strategy utilized by the `REGISTER` and `ATTACHMENT` data types, choose them all  — even if the data is already contained within the `MAP` object.

## Comparing a JSON Object

The `MAP` data type in DQL forms a tree-like, parent-child relationship within a document's dataset. This is similar to a JSON object, which functions as a single unit. However, a `MAP` allows:

- Nesting of various DQL data types:`REGISTER`, `MAP`, and `ATTACHMENT` as values for its keys.`
  `
- Each key-value pair within a `MAP` can be modified independently without affecting other pairs.

- Utilization of an *add-wins* merge strategy for conflict resolution. When conflicting changes occur during sync, all conflicting changes are retained rather than converging on only one. This ensures that no data is lost.

## MAP Data Structure

The response structure of a `MAP` is a JSON-like object; however, each field in a `MAP` has a corresponding data type. This means that each field within a `MAP` has an independent merge definition the same as fields on the top-level document.

The `MAP` type is useful when creating a list of non-conflicting items and updating items over time within a document.

The following snippet demonstrates a Ditto document with an embedded `MAP` `my_map`:

```json Ditto Document
{
  "_id": "123"
  "my_map": {
    "sub_field": "value",
  }
}
```
## Declaring a MAP

The `REGISTER` is the default data type in Ditto; therefore, there is no need for explicit declaration — it's implicitly assumed.

However, to use a `MAP` (and `ATTACHMENT`) data type, you must explicitly declare it within your DQL statement using t*ype definition *syntax.

A type definition is a description informing Ditto that the given set of key-value pairs embedded in the document as a nested structure is distinct from the default `REGISTER` type. This definition specifies how Ditto should handle the dataset within that nested structure.

To declare a data type a `MAP`, you use the `COLLECTION` identifier prefix, followed by the collection name enclosed in parentheses alongside a type definition. All done inline as follows:


```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (my_map_1 MAP, my_map_2 MAP, ...) ...
```

##  Merge Strategy with MAP

The `MAP` type has an add-wins merge behavior. This means that the adding or updating of a field always wins over the removal (`tombstone`) of the same field when performing a merge across two peers.

### Conflicts with Multiple Field Entries

If multiple fields are added across Small Peer devices, the result will be a `MAP` with all added fields. This is because each field within a `MAP` is associated with a distinct data type; that is, each can be represented as a `REGISTER`, `MAP`, or an `ATTACHMENT`.

That means, unlike a JSON blob object, which acts as a `REGISTER` functioning as a single unit, the merge strategy for each field within a `MAP` object depends on each of their data type representation.

In the following example, USER 1 inserts `item1` and USER 2 inserts `item2` to an `items` `MAP`:

```sql DQL
# USER 1 adds item1
UPDATE COLLECTION my_collection (items MAP)
SET
  items -> (item1 = 'red')
WHERE
  _id = '123'
```

```sql DQL
# USER 2 adds item2
UPDATE COLLECTION my_collection (items MAP)
SET
  items -> (item2 = 'blue')
WHERE
  _id = '123'
```


The resulting document contains an `items` `MAP` with both `item1` and `item2:`

```json Ditto Document
{
  "_id": "123"
  "items": {
    "item1": "red",
    "item2": "blue",
  }
}
```


### Comparing MAP With REGISTER Types

The nested JSON object functions as a `REGISTER `and closely resembles a nested `MAP` structure within a document. However, their merge strategies and supported types for nested values are significantly different.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial when selecting the appropriate data type for expressing your data structure.

#### Example Scenario

For example, consider a document with a `properties` field of the `REGISTER` data type storing information about a car in an embedded JSON object.

You want to change only the `color` field for a car identified by document ID `123` to `blue`.

Since a `REGISTER` acts as a single object, to update just the `color`, you'd need to update the entire object by providing the entire set of nested key-value pairs, including the modified `color` , as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
let newProperties = [
  "color": "blue",
  "sunroof": true,
  "door_count": 4
]

await ditto.store.execute(
  "UPDATE cars SET properties = :newProperties WHERE _id = '123'",
  ["newProperties": newProperties]);
```

```kotlin Kotlin
var result = ditto.store.execute(
  "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
  mapOf("newProperties"
    to mapOf("color" to "blue", "sunroof" to true, "door_count" to 4)))
```

```javascript JS
const newProperties = {
  color: 'blue',
  sunroof: true,
  door_count: 4
}

await ditto.store.execute(
  "UPDATE cars SET properties = :newProperties WHERE _id = '123'",
  {newProperties});
```

```java Java
Map<String, String> newProperties = new HashMap<>();
newCar.put("color", "blue");
newCar.put("sunroof", true);
newCar.put("door_count", 4);

DittoQueryResult result = (DittoQueryResult) ditto.store.execute(
  "UPDATE cars SET properties = :newProperties WHERE _id = '123'",
  Collections.singletonMap("newProperties", newProperties),
  new Continuation<>() {
    @NonNull
    @Override
    public CoroutineContext getContext() {
      return EmptyCoroutineContext.INSTANCE;
    }

    @Override
    public void resumeWith(@NonNull Object o) {
      if (o instanceof Result.Failure) {
        // Handle failure
      }
    }
  }
);
```

```csharp C#
var args = new Dictionary<string, object>();
args.Add("newProperties", new { color="blue", sunroof=true, doorCount=4});

await ditto.Store.ExecuteAsync(
  "UPDATE cars SET properties = :newProperties WHERE _id = '123'",
  args);
```

```cpp C++
struct Properties {
  std::string color;
  bool sunroof;
  int door_count;
};

// ...

std::map<std::string, Properties> args;
args["newProperties"] = {"blue", true, 4};

ditto.get_store().execute(
  "UPDATE cars SET properties = :newProperties WHERE _id = '123'",
  args);
```
</CodeGroup>

However, if the `properties` field is of the `
