[Accessing Data](/key-concepts/accessing-data) explains how to interact with the Ditto to insert, update, and delete data within the local database. The other key aspect of using Ditto is its ability to automatically synchronize data between devices in your mesh.

Ditto's synchronization model is designed for real-time, offline-first, and peer-to-peer (P2P) data propagation. Unlike traditional client-server architectures where clients must connect to a centralized database, Ditto enables direct communication between devices, ensuring that data stays available and up-to-date even when offline.
Data synchronization works the same whether the device is synchronizing with other devices in the mesh, or with the Big Peer.
Simply by subscribing to new data, Ditto ensures that data flows from elsewhere in the mesh to the subscribing device.

The following video provides an overview of Ditto's data synchronization capability:

## Subscription Queries

Synchronization in Ditto is event-driven. Instead of polling for changes, Ditto uses **subscription queries** that listen for updates and automatically receive new data in real time. With a subscription query, you can declaratively describe the data that you want a particular device to receive, whether that is all data within a collection or a filtered subset. When a query is subscribed, Ditto continuously syncs relevant documents that match the query's criteria between all connected peers.

### How Subscription Queries Work
1. A device adds a subscription query to listen for relevant data (see [Managing Subscriptions](/sdk/latest/sync/syncing-data) for more detail):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM cars
WHERE color = 'blue'
```
2. Ditto broadcasts this subscription query to all connected peers.
3. When a peer has data that matches the query, whether it is an initial sync or an incremental change, it is synced to the subscribing device.

## Conflict Resolution

A challenge arises in offline scenarios when two or more peers make edits independently and the data values stored by each peer diverge over time.

It is necessary to perform _conflict resolution_ to ensure that all peers ultimately reach the same value for a particular document.

This conflict resolution is powered by Ditto's use Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).
Ditto adheres to the following strategies to ensure that all peers ultimately reach the same value for a particular data item:
- Deterministic â€” As part of the strategy of eventual consistency, regardless of the order in which updates from different peers are received and merged, all peers ultimately converge to the same single value.
- Predictable and Meaningful â€” Instead of arbitrarily resolving conflicting `REGISTERs` to a predefined value, the resulting merge accurately represents the original input and some rational interpretation of that input.

### CRDTs

CRDTs are a specialized type of data structure that allow for concurrent, distributed updates to data. They are designed to be conflict-free, meaning that they can be merged together without conflict.

Ditto supports the following CRDT Data Types:
- Registers
- Maps
- Attachments

Each datatype uses summaries stored by Ditto on each mutation, to resolve conflicts based on the datatype's merge strategy.
The foundation of determining how data should be merged is using a Ditto document's [version vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector). The replication system uses the version vector to capture local and observed edits from other peers. 

Every time a change is made to a document, the version of that document is incremented by one.  When a peer incorporates changes from other peers, the local peer can use the incoming remote peer's version vectors to determine whether the changes are new or old. In other words, a peer can distinguish from other peer's incoming version vectors if the incoming data has "happened before" or not.

Say we have DocumentId: `"123abc"` on Peer A. 

```
DocumentId: "123abc"
Version Vector: {
  "A": 5,
  "B": 1,
  "C": 4
}
```

The version vector above represents that Peer `"A"` has incorporated change from other peers `"B"` and `"C"` at times `1` and `4` respectively.

If an incoming change arrives at Peer `"A"` with `"B": 4`, then Document will merge the incoming data. This is because Peer `"A"` determined that the document's current state has yet not seen the new change. 

```
DocumentId: "123abc"
Version Vector: {
  "A": 5,
  "B": 1, // ðŸ‘ˆ merge in {"B": 4} because 4 > 1
  "C": 4
}
```

#### Registers

A `REGISTER` stores a single scalar value. You can encode the value using any JSON-compatible scalar subtype, such as a `string`, `boolean`, JSON object to represent two or more fields as a single object, and so on.
Since a `REGISTER` acts as a single object, to update just a single nested field of an object stored in a `REGISTER`, you'd need to update the entire object by providing the entire set of nested key-value pairs.

The `REGISTER` type adheres to the *last-write-wins* principle when handling concurrency conflicts. This means that when changes occur, all peers observing the change will sequence these changes in the same order. This ensures that only a consistent single value syncs across the entire peer-to-peer mesh.

For example, one flight attendant updates a customer's seat number to `6` and another to seat `9`. When the two conflicting versions merge, the edit with the latest timestamp wins.
Put another way, by enforcing the last-write-wins merge strategy, for events A and B, where B is a result of A, event A always occurs before B.

#### Maps

The `MAP` type uses the add-wins approach to resolving concurrency conflicts.

So instead of choosing a single definitive value to merge and distribute across peers like the last-write-wins strategy utilized by the `REGISTER` and `ATTACHMENT` data types, you can choose them all  â€” even if the data is already contained within the `MAP` object.

The `MAP` data type in Ditto forms a tree-like, parent-child relationship within a document's dataset. This is similar to a JSON object, which functions as a single unit. However, a `MAP` allows:
- Nesting of various DQL data types:`REGISTER`, `MAP`, and `ATTACHMENT` as values for its keys.
- Each key-value pair within a `MAP` can be modified independently without affecting other pairs.
- Utilization of an *add-wins* merge strategy for conflict resolution. When conflicting changes occur during sync, all conflicting changes are retained rather than converging on only one. This ensures that no data is lost when merging independent changes to the `MAP`.

#### Attachments

The `ATTACHMENT` data type lets you link extensive amounts of binary data to a document for on-demand sync, both online or offline, without any conflicts. For instance, you can link and asynchronously sync large files that change infrequently or deeply embedded documents.

When incorporating an attachment into a document, rather than inserting the entire resource-heavy ATTACHMENT object, internally Ditto inserts a pointer object, known as the _attachment token_.

Unlike documents that are always accessible and automatically synced according to sync subscriptions, peers do not automatically fetch attachment data associated with a sync subscription. Therefore, before accessing an attachment, you must explicitly fetch it.

For practical guidance on using attachments within your application, see [Working with Attachments](/sdk/latest/crud/working-with-attachments)

### Causal Consistency

Causal Consistency is guaranteed by Ditto. It is causally consistent across any number of related
changes, across many documents and different collections, as long as they are
within the same Ditto AppID. 

To give an intuition about causal consistency,
imagine the following scenario:

On a social network Bob posts a message:

    Bob: "I lost my cat"

Then after some time, he posts:

    Bob: "I found him! What a relief!"

To which Sue replies:

    Sue: "Great news!"

In contrast, an **eventually consistent** database shows messages in any order:

    Bob: "I lost my cat"
    Sue: "Great news!"
    Bob: ...etc

Ditto's Causal Consistency ensures that if a new message is written after seeing some
prior message, then the new message is not visible unless that prior message is
also visible.

To help differentiate Causal Consistency from stronger consistency models, imagine that Alice replies:

    Alice: "Wonderful!"

Causal Consistency allows that the two concurrent messages "Great news!" from
Sue and "Wonderful!" from Alice appear in any order. Both of the following results are valid with Causal Consistency:

    Bob: "I lost my cat"
    Bob: "I found him! What a relief!"
    Sue: "Great news!"
    Alice: "Wonderful!"

And:

    Bob: "I lost my cat"
    Bob: "I found him! What a relief!"
    Alice: "Wonderful!"
    Sue: "Great news!"

## Metadata Database

Each peer individually maintains its own _metadata database_. The metadata database serves as a storage repository of information essential in resolving conflicts that arise when merging concurrent changes.

The metadata database manages the following essential details for a particular peer:

- The current state of sync.
- A record of the data previously sent and received.
- The sequence of updates.
- The timestamp of last write operation.
