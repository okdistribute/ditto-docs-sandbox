## Apps

In Ditto, an app is a grouping of collections.
All applications that embed the Ditto SDK and share the same app ID will automatically form a mesh network and synchronize data with each other, either directly or via the Big Peer.

While the name "App" suggests that a single Ditto app is a single application, it is common to have multiple Ditto-enabled mobile applications use a single Ditto app.

For example, in the context of a point-of-sale system, a single Ditto app is likely to be used by both the kiosks and the displays in the kitchen, even though these are two distinct mobile applications.

## Collections

Ditto stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.
Collections allow you to group similar documents together within the same namespace.

### Structuring Collections

While it is good practice for documents within a collection to share a similar structure — for instance, all car-related documents stored in the `cars` collection contain fields `'make'`, `'model'`, and `'year'` — structural uniformity is not mandatory.

There is no limit to the number of collections you can have in your data model, so create as many collections as you need.

### Managing Collections

Every document must be associated with a collection, even if only one document exists within that collection.

There are no explicit steps to manage collections; Ditto implicitly creates collections when you first store data for that collection.

### Querying Collections

When querying, database interactions occur with collections rather than individual documents.

For instance, the query below searches the entire `cars` collection once executed.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cars
```
