Since each specific combination contains a complete copy of the Ditto SDK's Rust code core, when supporting various platforms or different architectures, it adds to the overall size of the SDK package.

The following table provides a summary of the SDK sizes for different platform and architecture combinations supported by Ditto:

| **Language** | **Type**                        | **Size**    |
