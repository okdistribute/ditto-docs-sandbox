## Overview of RBAC

Previously, all end-user roles within an organization had the same access to app data. With the latest release, you can set fine-grained read-write access controls to app data.

For instance, create, modify, and delete custom roles; establish organization hierarchies for permissions delegation; set permissions for portal functionality like viewing collections, querying tokens, transferring apps between organizations; and more.

<Warning>
Since implementing role-based access control, organization members no longer have read-write access to app data by default.

To regain access, create custom roles that include permissions for accessing and modifying app data, and then assign these roles to the appropriate organization members. For instructions, see [Creating Roles](/cloud/portal/role-based-access-control#creating-new-roles) and [Assigning Roles](/cloud/portal/role-based-access-control#assigning-roles-to-end-users).

</Warning>

### Organization Permissions Settings

When configuring access control for roles within an organization, there are various types of privileges you can choose from.

Available within the portal > **Settings **> **Roles**, the following graphic and corresponding table provide an overview of the various settings you can configure for roles within an organization:

<Info>
As indicated using matching superscript numbers, some privileges have one or more dependencies with other privileges. For example:

- ¬π Selecting **Accept incoming app transfer requests **automatically toggles **View incoming app transfer requests**, granting both read and write privileges.
- ¬≤ Selecting **Access audit logs** automatically toggles **View access grants**, granting view access to active app transfer requests.

## Ditto Employee Access Grants

There are circumstances in which Ditto's support team requires elevated privileges to access your app data, for instance, to troubleshoot an issue.

Ditto employees can only access your app data with an approved *access grant*. An access grant is a formal authorization provided by any of the following to approve the access request initiated by Ditto:

- Current organization owner
- Organization roles configured with** Manage access grants** privileges

Once accepted, you can revoke access grants at any time. (See [Revoking Access](/cloud/portal/role-based-access-control#revoking-access))

For more information, see [Organization Permissions Settings](/cloud/portal/role-based-access-control#organization-permissions-settings) and [Accepting Access Grants](/cloud/portal/role-based-access-control#granting-access).

### Granting Access

To approve a Ditto-initiated access grant:

<Steps>
  <Step>
Click **Apps**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
