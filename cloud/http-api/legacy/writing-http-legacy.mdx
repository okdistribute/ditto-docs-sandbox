description: "Ditto provides a robust query engine that allows you to perform various filter operations to carry out traditional `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` (CRUD) operations."

 For an overview, see *Ditto Basics *> [CRUD Fundamentals](/sdk/latest/crud/create).

Use the `write` command to `upsert`, `update`, and `remove` documents from the Big Peer.

<Warning>
  Do *not *include a `find` query within a `write` command in a single operation. Instead, perform each as separate API calls. For instructions, see [Performing Find and Write Operations](/cloud/http-api/legacy/legacy-querying-http).
</Warning>


Once changes are made to the Big Peer, those changes then propagate to all Small Peers connected to the mesh network.

## Write Endpoint

To access Ditto's HTTP API, direct your write requests to the following URL endpoint, making sure to replace `{app_id}` with the ID Ditto generated when you created your app in the portal.

<Info>
For instructions on how to get your app ID, see [Get Started](/cloud/http-api/getting-started).
</Info>


```none
https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/store/write
```


## Upsert

The following snippet demonstrates how to use the `curl` command to perform a complete `upsert` operation to explicitly create or replace a document.

In this example, a `friends` key contains a `register` of the `array` type, alongside `orderCount` which functions as a `counter`.

<Info>
For more information about `registers` and `counters`, see the *Platform Manual* > [Data Types](/sdk/latest/data-types/register).
</Info>

```curl cURL
curl -X POST 'https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/store/write' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{
      "commands": [{
        "method": "upsert",
        "collection": "people",
        "id": "123abc",
        "value": {
          "name": "John",
          "friends": ["Susan"],
          "orderCount": 5
        }
      }]
  }'
```

### Specifying Types

When invoking `upsert`, use the `valueTypeOverrides` payload to create or modify a mutable type, such as a `register map` or a `counter`, in your request. For example, instead of using the default type, you explicitly specify to create a `counter` instead.

<Info>
In Ditto, an `array` behaves as a `register` by default. This means you do not need to explicitly specify an `array` as a `register` in your request.

For more information, see the *Platform Manual* > [REGISTER](/cloud/http-api/legacy/writing-http-legacy).

</Info>

```curl cURL
curl -X POST 'https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/store/write' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{
      "commands": [{
        "method": "upsert",
        "collection": "people",
        "id": "123abc",
        "value": {
          "name": "John",
          "friends": ["Susan"],
          "orderCount": 5
        },
        "valueTypeOverrides": {
          "orderCount": "counter",
          "friends": "register"
        }
      }]
  }'
```


## Update Subcommands

When using `update` to make changes in the Big Peer, you can include any of the following  subcommands within your `update` command to perform specific actions:

| **Subcommand**       | **Description**                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `set`                | Sets a specific value for a given field property. |
| `increment`          | Increments the value of a `counter`.              |
| `replaceWithCounter` | Replaces the current value with the `counter`.    |



```none

```


## Remove

Use the `remove` command to delete documents from the Big Peer and all Small Peers connected in the mesh network.

Once deleted, Ditto indicates a document's removal by creating a ***tombstone*** document. A tombstone contains metadata indicating that the associated data has been removed. Ditto creates a single tombstone for each document ID that matches the specified query.

To ensure that all Small Peers connected in the mesh network are aware that the document has been deleted, the tombstone, once created, triggers a change event that propagates across the mesh network as a record of its removal.


<Warning>
Although each tombstone document is not very large, there is no way to evict or remove them, so over time, if a user keeps doing `remove`operations, tombstones will be an "invisible" source of disk usage with no upper bound.

For this reason, we strongly encourage the use of `evict` (combined with a thoughtful subscription and soft-delete strategy) instead. Learn more about [EVICT](/cloud/http-api/legacy/writing-http-legacy).
</Warning>


For example, the following snippet demonstrates how to `remove` a document from the `people` collection where the `name` field is set to the value of `John`:

```curl cURL
curl -X POST 'https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/store/write' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "commands": [{
        "method": "remove",
        "collection": "people",
        "query": "name==\'John\'"
     }]
}'
```
