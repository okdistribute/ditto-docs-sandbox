 The Big Peer is an optional feature for managing and coordinating data in the peer-to-peer mesh network. For more information, see [Cloud Platform Overview](http://localhost:3000).

The HTTP data API is designed following the principles of the remote procedure call (RPC) framework. So, despite the actual exchange occurring over a network, you make requests from Ditto's API methods as if making local calls.

This article provides an overview of the HTTP data API:

## About RPC Framework

The RPC framework is of the request-response category, where a client sends one message to the Big Peer and receives one response in return.

The HTTP API is structured around various *resources*, which are endpoints you call in your code to perform specific actions, such as `update`, and receive corresponding responses from the Big Peer.

These resources correspond to the key elements of the Ditto document model. For more information, see [Document Model](/sdk/v4-8/document-model/fields).

## Cloud URL Endpoint

Use the Ditto HTTP API to integrate external systems with Ditto-backed apps hosted on `cloud.ditto.live` and programmatically interact with them using an HTTP server interface.

The following URL is the base location from which you can make your HTTP API requests:

```bash cURL
curl https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4
```


### Getting Your Canonical Root URL

For your canonical root URL, go to the Ditto portal > select your app > and then, from the **Connecting via HTTP **group at the bottom of the page, copy your **Cloud URL Endpoint**:

</Frame>
## Swagger Endpoint

To access the HTTP API reference, use the following URL endpoint to view the OpenAPI swagger.json specification. For more information, see the official Swagger documentation > <a href="https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/" target="_blank">OpenAPI Specification</a>.

When accessing the swagger.json specification, make sure to replace the `{app_id}` parameter with the unique app ID provided when you created your app in the portal:

<Card
>
https://\{app_id\}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/swagger.json
</Card>

## Data Representations

Ditto uses UTF-8 to encode data. For more information, see [Encoding Standard: UTF-8](/cloud/http-api/getting-started#encoding-standard-utf-8).

Unless otherwise specified, the default representation format for individual resources is JSON, as indicated by the `Contentâ€‘Type` HTTP header included in your response:


```none
Content-Type: application/json
```


### Encoding Standard: UTF-8

Unless you have a specific requirement for a different encoding, encode your input data in *UTF-8*. UTF-8 is a variable-length schema for universal character encoding. For more information, see the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" target="_blank">"UTF-8" Wikipedia article</a>.

<Warning>
Make sure to encode your text-based data, such as JSON, using the UTF-8 encoding.

If using another format to encode, such as UTF-16, decoding errors and invalid results are likely to occur.
</Warning>


### Encoding Formats: Binary Data

To transmit binary data, such as a media file, to the Big Peer, you must first convert it into either of the following formats:

- For smaller data, use a Base64-encoded `string`.
- For larger data, use an `ATTACHMENT` object. (See [HTTP API - Attachments](/cloud/http-api/attachments))

The following table provides an overview of the acceptable encoding formats by binary size:

| **Binary Size**       | **Encoding Format**                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Below 250 KB          | Base64-encoded `string` value                                                                                                                              |
| Between 250KB and 2MB | `ATTACHMENT` object                                                                                                                                        |
| 2MB and above         | This will be rejected as the payload is too large. Please get in contact with Ditto Support to have this limit increased for your deployment if necessary. |

Once converted, include your Base64-encoded `string` in your request.

<Warning>
  Failing to send binary data encoded with either Base64 or an `ATTACHMENT`, as appropriate, may result in compatibility issues leading to data corruption or loss.
</Warning>
