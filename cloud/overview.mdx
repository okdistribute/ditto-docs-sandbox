As data demands grow, you can scale your app resources both horizontally and vertically by splitting them across multiple virtual or physical nodes and more.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Big Peer; the system component that, although functionally equivalent to a traditional cloud database, operates as a trusted peer in the distributed peer-to-peer network.

## Key Services

As illustrated in the following graphic, the Big Peer cloud deployment seamlessly integrates with Small Peer end-user environments, providing critical authentication services and serving as a conduit for mesh-generated data by way of the HTTP data API.

Additionally, it supports third-party data analytics tools by offering Apache Kafka change data capture (CDC).

The following table provides an overview of the critical services that the Big Peer provides to the Ditto cluster:

| **Service**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Sync engine and resources | A powerful and feature-rich system capable of storing and orchestrating very large amounts of data. ([Backend Architecture](/cloud/backend-architecture))                                                                    |
| Authentication service    | Enables connected Small Peers to obtain valid certificates to participate in the mesh and replicate data they have permissions for. ([Authentication](/sdk/latest/auth-and-authorization/cloud-authentication))                                                                     |
| HTTP Data API             | A stateless API you can use to perform various one-time operations on the Big Peer for programmatic data ingress, reading, and manipulation. ([HTTP API - Getting Started](/cloud/http-api/getting-started)) |
| Apache Kafka              | A premium option for Big Peer streaming between Ditto and any Kafka-backed external systems and services you choose.([Change Data Capture](/cloud/cdc))                                                      |
