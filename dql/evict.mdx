title: EVICT
description: "The `EVICT` operation removes one or more documents from the local Ditto store, deleting them entirely without flagging (`tombstone`) as deleted to remote peers:"
---

```sql DQL
EVICT FROM your_collection_name
WHERE [condition]
```

In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to retrieve the data.
- `[condition]` represents the condition or criteria that determine which documents should be evicted from the local peer.

## Examples Deleting Documents

Here, documents from the `cars` collection that have the document ID `123` get removed from the Ditto store:


```sql DQL
EVICT FROM cars
WHERE _id = '123'
```

As another example, the following snippet, once executed, results in the deletion of documents with timestamps greater than a certain value:


```sql DQL
EVICT FROM cars
WHERE some_time_stamp > 1699888298000
```


## Removing Fields from Documents

To remove a specific field from a document, use an UPDATE statement to *tombstone* that field. A tombstone is a flag signaling to remote peers that the  data type has been removed. See: [UPDATE](/dql/update)

## Removing Data from Big Peer

`EVICT` is not currently available for the Big Peer, although it's in development. To learn more about removing data from your Big Peer instance, see [Writing: HTTP (Legacy)](/cloud/http-api/legacy/writing-http-legacy#remove) .

## Developing an Eviction Strategy

Removing data from a distributed database is a difficult problem, and memory management requires careful consideration of both subscriptions and evictions.
