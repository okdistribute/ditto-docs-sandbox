title: EVICT
description: "The `EVICT` operation removes one or more documents from the local Ditto store, deleting them entirely without flagging (`tombstone`) as deleted to remote peers:"
---

```sql DQL
EVICT FROM your_collection_name
WHERE [condition]
```

In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to retrieve the data.
- `[condition]` represents the condition or criteria that determine which documents should be evicted from the local peer.

## Examples Deleting Documents

Here, documents from the `cars` collection that have the document ID `123` get removed from the Ditto store:


```sql DQL
EVICT FROM cars
WHERE _id = '123'
```

As another example, the following snippet, once executed, results in the deletion of documents with timestamps greater than a certain value:


```sql DQL
EVICT FROM cars
WHERE some_time_stamp > 1699888298000
```


## Removing Fields from Documents

To remove a specific field from a document, use an UPDATE statement to *tombstone* that field. A tombstone is a flag signaling to remote peers that the  data type has been removed. See: [UPDATE](/dql/update)

## Removing Data from Big Peer

`EVICT` can be enabled for Big Peer by request. Please [contact us](/support/contact-us) if you'd like to use this feature.

Note that any data evicted from Big Peer will reappear if it exists in any Small Peer devices connected to Big Peer.

To permanently remove the data, you must first ensure the data is no longer subscribed to, and is already evicted, by any connected Small Peers. See [Developing an Eviction Strategy](#developing-an-eviction-strategy) for more.

Alternatively, data can be tombstoned from Big Peer using the legacy API. See: [Writing: HTTP (Legacy)](/cloud/http-api/legacy/writing-http-legacy#remove).

## Developing an Eviction Strategy

Removing data from a distributed database is a difficult problem, and memory management requires careful consideration of both subscriptions and evictions.

To learn more about our recommended strategies, see [DELETE](/v4-8/crud/delete).
